## 2026-01-23 - [Insecure Data Access in getTickets]
**Vulnerability:** The `getTickets` function in `services/data.ts` had a commented-out line that was intended to filter tickets by `user_id`. This meant that any call to this function, even with a specific `userId`, would retrieve *all* tickets from the database. This effectively disabled the intended filtering, potentially exposing all user tickets to any authenticated user if backend Row Level Security (RLS) policies were not strictly enforcing isolation based on the user's session token alone.
**Learning:** Security logic (like data filtering) must never be commented out. Relying on client-side code to "behave" without enforcing it in the data query is insecure.
**Prevention:** Enforce data filtering at the lowest possible level (database or query builder). Ensure that optional parameters for filtering are actually used when provided.
